# Trajectory-Based UAV Location Integrity Analysis

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks that implement the data preprocessing and transformation pipeline used in our trajectory-driven deep learning approach for UAV location integrity checks.

The work is based on the research published in **IEEE Access (2024)**:  
**"Trajectory-Driven Deep Learning for UAV Location Integrity Checks"**  
DOI: [10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3507637](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3507637)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The goal of this project is to detect GPS spoofing and location falsification attacks in UAVs **without using GPS signal-specific features**, instead relying on **movement-based trajectory features**. The project builds a machine learning pipeline that transforms raw UAV flight logs into structured sequences suitable for RNN and Transformer-based models.

## ðŸ§± Notebook Structure & Version History

Each notebook corresponds to a stage in the research development process, showing incremental improvements in data preprocessing and representation.

| Version | Notebook                         | Description |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `v2`   | `01_dataset_preprocessing.ipynb` | Basic data loading and preprocessing. This version implements the initial cleaning and organization of raw UAV flight data (CSV format). Includes class labeling and partitioning into clean vs. attack samples. |
| `v7`   | `02_sequence_data_builder.ipynb` | Implements **sequence construction** using a sliding window over timestamped flight records. Converts tabular data into fixed-length sequences to enable time-series modeling. |
| `v8`   | `03_transformer_input_builder.ipynb` | Focuses on Transformer-specific data handling. Adds normalization and trajectory-aware features such as positional deltas, Euclidean distance, and velocity vectors for attention-based models. |
| `v9`   | `04_full_sequence_pipeline.ipynb` | Full preprocessing pipeline including sequence transformation, feature engineering, and model-ready input preparation. Integrates all prior improvements and serves as the final data builder for model training. |
